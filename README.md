This Hololens prototype guides the user through the steps of Cantor's proof that real numbers are uncountable.

**Features :**

 - Voice and gaze controls : voice recognition is used to go from one step to another, while the gaze is used to display supplementary concepts.

- Designed for head-mounted display : the Hololens allows the user to switch between the interactive proof shown in augmented reality, and traditional pen-and-paper resolution.
